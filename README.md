React To-Do List App
This is a simple To-Do List application built with React. It allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. The app supports task filtering (all, completed, incomplete) and stores tasks in the browserâ€™s localStorage so your tasks stay saved on page reload.

Remove tasks

Mark tasks as completed/uncompleted by clicking on the task

Filter tasks by All, Completed, or Incomplete

Edit existing tasks

Data persistence with localStorage

How to Use
Add a Task: Type a task in the input box and click "Add Task".

Toggle Completion: Click on the task text to mark it completed or incomplete.

Filter Tasks: Use the "All", "Completed", and "Incomplete" buttons to filter the task list.
